# WebScrapping-AmericanVisa

Getting a visa is the dream of many people around the world, but during the Covid 19 pandemic, getting data available at the Consulate is almost always distant.

With that in mind, I developed this script in Python to automatically enter the American Visa scheduling website, check a closer date and send the information relevant to the search carried out by the script in your email.

This design can be improved and improved.
